blur-my-shell@aunetx
  Name: Blur my Shell
  Description: Adds a blur look to different parts of the GNOME Shell, including the top panel, dash and overview.

You can support my work by sponsoring me on:
- github: https://github.com/sponsors/aunetx

If you use Ubuntu, you may want to change the radius of the corner effect for Dash-to-Dock in preferences, else you may see unpleasantly mixed radii in your dock.

Note: if the extension shows an error after updating, please make sure to restart your session to see if it persists. This is due to a bug in gnome shell, which I can't fix by myself.
